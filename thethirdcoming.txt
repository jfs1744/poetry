#1
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
Are full of passionate intensity.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it

#2
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

#3
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
The darkness drops again; but now I know
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Are full of passionate intensity.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
That twenty centuries of stony sleep

#4
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Surely some revelation is at hand;
The darkness drops again; but now I know
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
That twenty centuries of stony sleep

#5
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it

#6
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
The darkness drops again; but now I know
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
