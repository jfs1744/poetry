1 Turning and turning in the widening gyre
1 The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
1 Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
1 Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
1 The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
1 The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
1 The best lack all conviction, while the worst
1 Are full of passionate intensity.

2 Surely some revelation is at hand;
2 Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
2 The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
2 When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
2 Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
2 A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
3 A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
3 Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
3 Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
3 The darkness drops again; but now I know
3 That twenty centuries of stony sleep
3 Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
3 And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
3 Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
